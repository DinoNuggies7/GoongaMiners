    "long_description": "# Better Trees [bettertrees]\nMakes trees more realistic.\n\nLeaves are climbable, but be careful, they chance break.\n\nLeaves can fall occasionally, and they can regrow.\n\nPlease don't punch a tree, you're not strong enough to break it. You might hurt your hand though. But when you do find a tool to cut a tree down, it does fall.\n\nLeaves can be crafted into sticks, think of it as taking the leaves off of a branch and getting a big stick.\n\nLeaves don't like to be stacked, and you can't reattach leaves you took off of a tree.\n\n## Dependencies\nNo dependencies. This loops through any and all nodes in group:tree and group:leaves and overrides them. Any mod or game providing such nodes will be affected.\n- [default] (optional) - Allows for adding a craft recipe to convert leaves to sticks (1:1), as well as providing default sounds and textures.\n- [3d_armor] (optional) - Experimental. Wearing armor increases chance of leaves breaking while climbing.\n- [mcl_core], [mcl_sounds] (optional) - Experimental support for Mineclone games.\n\n## Recommendations\n* [loose_rocks] - scatters rocks on ground to collect to make cobble\n* [charcoal] - \"cook\" trees to get charcoal; don't use with [coalfromtrees] as this creates a conflicting recipe, use one or the other. Not needed if using with [ethereal].\n* [stripped_tree] - I can only recommend this once my PRs for it are merged. Adds bark and stripped trees.\n\n## Credits\n* @luatic - \"extrusion_mesh_16.obj\" - provided mesh for stick nodes\n* Tenplus1 - [regrow], inspired me to make leaves and fruits regrow\n* Hamlet - [soft_leaves] and its forum thread, inspired me to make this mod\n* Hamlet - [hard_trees_redo] inspired me to recreate the hard trees concept\n* Hamlet - [fallen_trees] inspired me to make trees fall\n* VanessaE - [trunks] from [plantlife_modpack] inspired me to add sticks on the ground\n\n## Notes\nThis mod replaces the need to have Hamlet's [soft_leaves], [hard_trees_redo], [fallen_trees] and the mods those were based off of. This doesn't completely replace [hard_trees_redo]. Since [hard_trees_redo] adds alternative means of getting cobble, I recommend using [loose_rocks] to make up for that functionality. It is out of the scope of this mod to do some of what [hard_trees_redo] does, such as adding the possibility of dirt nodes dropping rocks and elimination of wooden tools.\n\nThe mod [sticks_stones] also scatters rocks on the ground like [loose_rocks], but they also add a recipe to get sticks from leaves. It's a 3:1 conversion, which doesn't make sense to me; a 1:1 conversion like I have in this mod seems more realistic. Because that mod and my mod have those craft recipes, using them together will add both recipes. As such, I recommend using [loose_rocks] instead of [sticks_stones]. Plus [loose_rocks]'s rocks look really cool.\n\nThere are a handful of tree-cutting mods in ContentDB ([fallen_trees], [lumberjack], [woodcutting], [choppy], [vein_miner], [treecapitator]). This mod implements the same kind of method for tree-cutting as [fallen_trees], by just adding tree nodes to the `falling_nodes` group. I have not tested the other tree-cutting mods with this mod, so I can't guarantee that they'll work as expected. There is a [treecapitator] mod on the Forums that makes trees fall over, but it is buggy and needs a lot of TLC. I may redo it and integrate it here.\n\nI tried to integrate the behavior from [bouncy_leaves], but it appears you can't bounce on climbable nodes nor take any damage from falling on them. So keep in mind that [bouncy_leaves] doesn't work with this mod or similar mods that make leaves climbable.\n\nAlso note that mods that enable regrowing fruits (e.g. [regrow], [regrowing]) aren't needed as this behavior is done dynamically.\n\nIn the settings, you can toggle the rendering of leaves to be bushy meshes (`true`) or regular node boxes (`false`). This is similar to what is done in [bushy_leaves]. This mod is more performant than [bushy_leaves], since I use meshes instead of node boxes (thanks to Singularis for creating meshes, see `LICENSE` file for license of those meshes)\n\n## Potential Future Additions\nThese features may or may not be developed in the future, either in this mod or another.\n* Make leaves potentially break when any entity is in tree (may be more resource intensive)\n* Add settings to tweek chances of leaves breaking or falling, and break/fall behavior (either dig or fall)\n* Make trees fall over while chopping down tree\n* Add variety of schematics for tree templates\n* Implement tree growth stages\n* Add support for [stripped_tree] as an optional dependency to add the ability to strip trees to get bark.\n\n## Change Log\nv1.0.0 - Initial release\n \nv1.0.1 - Fixed stick decoration and typo in README.md\n\nv1.0.2 - Fixed log level\n\nv1.1.0 - Implemented bushy leaves, regrowing fruits, removed obsolete comments\n\nv1.2.0 - Uncommented wield_image line to fix wielding sticks; added support for MCL2 & 5",
