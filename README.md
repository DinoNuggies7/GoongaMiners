GoongaMiners
========

GoongaMiners is a monke game designed after the feeling of playing in the backyard with sticks. GoongaMiners uses Minetest and MineClone2 (a subgame for Minetest) as a base. I am planning on making my own textures for everything in the future, and making a release that includes binaries for Windows and Linux.


# Building
Compile just like any other cmake project.

```fish
git clone https://github.com/DinoNuggies4665/GoongaMiners.git && cd GoongaMiners
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
```
